    "## Iterators\n",
    "> An iterator is an object that can be iterated (looped) over or an object which contains a countable number of values. It consists of two main methods: ` __iter__()` and `__next__()`. <br> In the provided example, the `__iter__` method is not strictly necessary because the __iter__ method of the iterator is, by default, the iterator object itself (in this case, self). In Python, if the __iter__ method is not explicitly defined, and the object has a `__next__` method, the object is considered its own iterator.<br> \n",
    "**Implicit Iterator:**\n",
    "If an object has a `__next__` method, and the `__iter__` method is not explicitly defined, Python considers the object itself as the iterator.\n",
    "The `__next__` method is called for each iteration.\n",
    "<br>**Using self as Iterator:**\n",
    "Since the SimpleIterator class has a `__next__` method, and `__iter__` is not defined, the instance of the class (self) is used as the iterator. <br>\n",
    "The for loop implicitly calls the `__iter__` method (which is not explicitly defined), and since it's not defined, it defaults to using self (the instance of SimpleIterator) as the iterator. Then, it calls the `__next__` method for each iteration."

    "> Generators are a concise way to create iterators in Python. They are defined using a function with the yield keyword, which saves the state of the function and can be resumed later. <br>\n",
    "A generator in Python is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of data without loading the entire sequence into memory. Unlike regular functions that compute all values at once and return them in a list, generators produce values one at a time using the yield keyword. <br>\n",
    "> - **Lazy Evaluation:**\n",
    "Generators use lazy evaluation, meaning they produce values on-the-fly as they are needed, rather than computing and storing all values in advance.\n",
    "> - **Memory Efficiency:**\n",
    "Generators are memory-efficient, particularly for handling large datasets, as they only maintain the current state and do not store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "> - **State Maintenance:**\n",
    "The generator function retains its state between successive calls, allowing it to continue execution from where it left off.\n",
    "> - **Syntax:**\n",

    "#### Difference between Iterators and Generators:\n",
    "> **Creation:**\n",
    "Iterators: Created by implementing the __iter__ and __next__ methods in a class. The __iter__ method returns the iterator object, and __next__ is responsible for producing the next value.<br>\n",
    "Generators: Created using a function with the yield keyword. The function automatically becomes an iterator, and each yield statement produces a value.<br>\n",
    "> **Memory Usage:**\n",
    "Iterators: May store the entire sequence in memory, leading to higher memory usage, especially for large datasets.<br>\n",
    "Generators: Consume memory on-demand, producing values one at a time, which is more memory-efficient.<br>\n",
    "> **Execution Flow:**\n",
    "Iterators: The entire iteration logic is defined in the `__next__` method, and the state is maintained within the class.<br>\n",
    "Generators: The function's state is suspended at each yield statement, allowing it to resume execution when the next value is needed.<br>\n",
    "> **Syntax:**\n",
    "Iterators: Requires explicit implementation of `__iter__` and `__next__` methods, leading to more boilerplate code.<br>\n",
    "Generators: Defined using a simpler syntax with the yield keyword, making the code more concise.<br>\n",
    "> **Use Cases:**\n",
    "Iterators: Useful when you need fine-grained control over the iteration process and want to encapsulate it within a class.\n",
    "Generators: Ideal for scenarios where lazy evaluation and memory efficiency are crucial, such as working with large datasets or infinite sequences.<br>\n",
    "while iterators are a more general concept, generators are a specific implementation of iterators in Python that simplifies the creation and use of iterators, especially in scenarios with lazy evaluation and memory constraints.<br>\n",
    "> Local Variables arenâ€™t used in Iterators.                                         \n",
    "\n",
    "> All the local variables before the yield function are stored in generators. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Iterators are used mostly to iterate or convert other objects to an iterator using iter() function. <br>          Generators are mostly used in loops to generate an iterator by returning all the values in the loop without affecting the iteration of the loop<br>\n",
